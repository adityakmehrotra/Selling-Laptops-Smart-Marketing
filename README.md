# Selling-Laptops-Smart-Marketing

## Project Overview

This Python project aims to predict user interest in a promotional email campaign for a laptop sale on a retail website. By analyzing historical user interaction data with similar promotions, the project utilizes a Logistic Regression model to classify users likely to be interested in the campaign. The goal is to increase campaign effectiveness by targeting the right audience and achieving high user engagement.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Combines user demographic and behavioral data to form a comprehensive dataset.
- **Custom Preprocessing**: Implements a column transformer to handle categorical and numerical data.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes a logistic regression within a pipeline that includes preprocessing steps.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Predicts user interest based on their profiles and past interactions.

## Technology Stack

- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- GeoPandas for geographic data operations (if applicable)
- Matplotlib and Rasterio for data visualization and raster data handling
- Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling and evaluations
- SQLite for database interactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed, along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:
